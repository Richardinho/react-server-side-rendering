# React Redux server-side rendering example
## app.js
A React component wrapped inside a Redux container (create using connect() method).
Simply displays the applications state property `phrase`

## index.js
Bootstrapping script on the client side. Uses the `hydrate` method to render the application to the page, replacing the server side rendered html. Note that if the rendered HTML isn't exactly the same as that from the server, React throws a warning.

## reducer.js
The reducer for the application. Currently does nothing fancier than return the state of the app so that Redux works.

## server.js
Bootstrapping script on the server side. In order to simulate asynchronous calls to fetch data, the main rendering is done within a setTimeout callback. `renderToString` is used to generate the HTML that is sent to the client. As mentioned above, this HTML must be identical to that generated by the client side code.

## webpack.config.js

Config script for generating bundle that is sent to client side.
